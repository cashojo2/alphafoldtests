Demonstrates use of alphafold to predict a protein's 3D structure given the input amino acid sequence. In this case, the program was used to predict the structure of murine ADA D295E. The fasta file was retrieved from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank. Bash was used to write a shell script for the job and communicate with the hpc
